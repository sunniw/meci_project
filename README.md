This script is developed to find out the publication date of the magazine Knightly World ([武俠世界](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=69463537 "武俠世界")), which helps cataloging work at Anobii. It provides an **approximate** publication date based on the issue number inputted by the user.

The magazine was published in Hong Kong from April 1959 to January 2019. Without access to the actual copies, I depended mostly on open access resources available on ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22%E6%AD%A6%E4%BF%A0%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%87%BA%E7%89%88%E7%A4%BE%22&sort=-date)) and Anobii's user submittions. Over the 60 years, the magazine had undergone multiple changes. Certain publication changes were unclear due to missing issues on Internet Archive, mostly published before 1982. A note would be given if the script works on those issues.
