    "# (1) when did the magazine start publishing weekly instead of semi-monthly -- possibly from issue 16 on 1959-11-07,\n",
    "# (2) from when it changed schedule from Saturday to Thursday -- between issue 572 and 583, and\n",
    "# (3) the conflict of the starting date (March or April, 1959).\n",
    "# Any generated date or issue falls within the above unclear issues will be remarked in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key dates/years:\n",
    "# Issue 583: Earliest issue except Issue 1 that is available on Internet Archive. Claimed first published in 1959 March, weekly on Thursday.\n",
    "# Issue 986 (1978-05-22): Officially changed publication day to Monday. Editorial explained it was available on Monday for years while putting Thursdays as publication day.\n",
    "# Issue 1184 (1982-02-22): Last issue counting without year.\n",
